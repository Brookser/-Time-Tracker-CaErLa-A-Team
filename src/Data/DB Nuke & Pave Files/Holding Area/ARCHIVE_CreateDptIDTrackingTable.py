# Date:             05.22.2025
# Description:      creates and then populates table so employee department
#                       changes can be tracked
#
#                     1. Table Creation
#                     Creates employee_department_history table with proper structure:
#                     HISTORY_ID: Auto-increment primary key
#                     EMPID: Employee ID (foreign key to employee_table)
#                     DPTID: Department ID (foreign key to department)
#                     ASSIGNMENT_DATE: Date assigned to department
#                     CREATED_TIMESTAMP: When record was created
#
#                     2. Proper Database Design
#                     Foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
#                     Indexes on EMPID, DPTID, and ASSIGNMENT_DATE for performance
#                     UTF8MB4 charset for consistency with existing tables
#
#                     3. Data Population
#                     Pulls ALL current employee-department assignments from employee_table
#                     Includes both active and inactive employees as requested
#                     Includes both active and inactive departments
#                     Uses 2025-05-20 as the assignment date for all records
#
#                     4. Comprehensive Verification
#                     Shows department distribution summary
#                     Displays sample records with employee/department names
#                     Verifies foreign key constraints are working
#                     Provides summary statistics
#
#                     5. Safety Features
#                     Checks if table already exists and asks before dropping
#                     Uses transactions with rollback on errors
#                     Detailed error handling and status reporting
#                     Follows your established style guide
#
#                     What Gets Populated:
#                     The script will populate the table with entries for all 40
#                           employees currently in the database, including:#
#                     Active employees in active departments
#                     Active employees in inactive departments (like D001)
#                     Inactive employees (like E9008, E9017, E9020)
#                     All with assignment date of 2025-05-20
#
#
# Input:            none
# Output:           confirmation message
# Sources:          Project Charter
#
# Change Log:       - 05.22.2025: Initial setup
